Creating a simple calculator in Python using functions to perform arithmetic operations and then implementing a basic user interface to interact with these functions. 
This create a command-line calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
We define four functions add, subtract, multiply, and divide to perform basic arithmetic operations.
The calculator function acts as the main driver for the program. It displays a menu of operations and takes user input to perform the desired operation.
The program continuously runs inside a while True loop until the user chooses to exit (by entering '5').
The input function is used to get user input for operation choice and the numbers to perform the operation on.
We handle basic input validation to ensure that the user enters a valid choice (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) and valid numbers for arithmetic operations.

To run this calculator:
Run the file using Python (python calculator.py).
Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
